<div class="container">
    <h1>My Hypothesis</h1>
    <p>Regarding this hypothesis, I believe that the price of a car depends on several factors:</p>

    <ul>
        <li> Car Mileage is the most significant factor influencing car price. 
        </li>
        <li>  Year of Production is the 2 most important factor and car tier is just narrowly less valuable.
        </li>
        <li>Engine volume and drivetrain are moderately notable and have comparable levels of impact.</li>
        <li>     Transmission, Fuel Type, Specialness show weak relationships with car price and of these three Specialness is the least impactful because
             we can see that price nearly does not change with Specialness increasing and even drops almost by half when hitting its maximum point</li>
    </ul>
    <p>My idea involves restructuring our data set. I plan to introduce new columns that contain types of
         fuel, transmission, drivetrain, Car Tier represented digitally. 
         I have already splitted our cars into "tiers" for convenience</p>

    <p><strong>Returning to my hypothesis, let's analyze key aspects of the plot:</strong></p>

    <ul>
        <li>1) Mileage is the most influential factor affecting car price. As mileage increases, the price decreases significantly, showing its critical importance.
        </li>
        <li>2) The year of production is the second most important factor. Newer cars (with a higher year of production) are generally more expensive, highlighting the strong influence of this parameter.
        </li>
        <li>3) Car Tier ranks third in importance, slightly behind the year of production. Its effect on price is reflected through distinct clusters corresponding to different tiers.
        </li>
        <li>4) Engine volume and drivetrain have a reasonable and similar influence on car price. Their impact is noticeable but less significant than mileage, year of production, and car tier.
        </li>
        <li> 5) Transmission type, fuel type, and specialness show weak relationships with car price. Among these, Specialness is the least impactful: price remains almost unchanged as specialness increases
        </li>
    </ul>

    * Price vs. Car Mileage (-0.32293):
    There is a strong negative correlation between price and mileage. This indicates that the price of a car decreases with increase of mileage
    * Price vs. Year of Production (0.23571):
    There is a positive correlation between the year of production and car price. Newer cars tend to have higher prices, but the correlation is slightly weaker than that of mileage. 
    * Price vs. Transmission_rating (0.09886):
    THere is a very weak positive correlation, meaning it has minimal impact on car price. 
    * Price vs. Engine Volume (0.27725):
     There is a considerable positive correlation. 
     * Price vs. Car Tier_rating (0.40480):
     There is the most significant positive correlation between price and Car Tier. A lower-tier rating corresponds to a higher price drop, suggesting car tier is very important factor influencing price
    * Price vs Specialness (0.15611):
    There is a weak but still noticeable positive correlation of specialness and price. 
    * Price vs Fuel Type_rating (0.14317):
    There is weak positive correlation between Fuel Type and Price showing that it's influence is practically negligible
    * Price vs Drivetrain_rating (0.25509):
    THere is a strong positive correlation between price and drivetrain. It is an important factor

    <p>Now let's pay attention to correlations to find the truth.</p>
    <img src="../static/heatmap.png"/>
    <p><strong>In my opinion, only correlations with 0.5 and bigger can be caused by some real connections, but other
        correlations are just coincidences.</strong></p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Price vs. Car Mileage (-0.32293):</strong> There is a strong negative correlation between price and mileage. This indicates that the price of a car decreases with increase of mileage
        </li>
        <li><strong>Price vs. Year of Production (0.23571):</strong>  There is a positive correlation between the year of production and car price. Newer cars tend to have higher prices, but the correlation is slightly weaker than that of mileage. 
        </li>
        <li><strong>Price vs. Transmission_rating (0.09886):</strong> THere is a very weak positive correlation, meaning it has minimal impact on car price. 
        </li>
        <li><strong>Price vs. Engine Volume (0.27725):</strong>  There is a considerable positive correlation. 
        </li>
        <li><strong>Price vs. Car Tier_rating (0.40480):</strong> There is the most significant positive correlation between price and Car Tier. A lower-tier rating corresponds to a higher price drop, suggesting car tier is very important factor influencing price
        </li>
        <li><strong>Price vs Specialness (0.15611):</strong> There is a weak but still noticeable positive correlation of specialness and price. 
        </li>
        <li><strong>Price vs Fuel Type_rating (0.14317):</strong> There is weak positive correlation between Fuel Type and Price showing that it's influence is practically negligible
        </li>
        <li><strong>Price vs Drivetrain_rating (0.25509):</strong>  THere is a strong positive correlation between price and drivetrain. It is an important factor
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Contrary to my expectations, the analysis proves that Car Tier(brand) plays a more crucial role than mileage and year of production in influencing the price.
         Furthermore, Engine Volume is more valuable than we expected slightly surpassing both Year of Production and Drivetrain. 
        A new discovery for me is that I expected Specialness to be the least impactful among Fuel Type and Transmission but it turned out to be the most impactful. </strong></p>

    <p>To summarize my hypothesis testing, it is important to mention that these correlations are not absolute (
        not close to ±1). But we can still understand that my hypothesis about stronger dependencies between these
        factors turns out to be mostly true but some of the hypothesized factors have a smaller percentage of the
         overall correlation structure than we originally expected.</p>
