Now lets add Fuel Type_rating column
1. Gasoline is the most common fuel type for cars and offers decent performance and availability. However, it's not as efficient or environmentally friendly as other options like diesel, hybrid, or electric vehicles. Thus, it gets a moderate score in the middle of the range. 6/10
2. Diesel engines are known for their higher fuel efficiency and durability, especially for long-distance travel and heavy-duty vehicles. They may also produce fewer CO2 emissions per gallon compared to gasoline, which can make them a high-priority choice for efficiency-focused applications. However, diesel is criticized for emitting more particulates and NOx, which may explain why it doesn't receive a perfect 10. 9/10
3. Electric vehicles (EVs) are seen as the future of transportation due to their zero tailpipe emissions and lower long-term energy costs. They are environmentally friendly but currently have some limitations, such as reliance on charging infrastructure and battery production concerns (e.g., mining impact). These factors could explain why they rank just below diesel in your system. 8/10
4. E85 Flex Fuel is less common and not as widely adopted. It often offers lower energy efficiency (fewer miles per gallon) compared to pure gasoline or diesel, and its availability is limited to certain regions. This might explain why it is ranked lower. 3/10
5. Hybrid vehicles combine a gasoline engine with an electric motor, offering better fuel efficiency and reduced emissions compared to traditional gasoline cars. However, hybrids donâ€™t achieve the same level of eco-friendliness or innovation as pure electric vehicles, which might justify their slightly lower ranking. 7/10
6. Flexible fuel vehicles can run on gasoline or ethanol blends. While this versatility is beneficial, they may not be optimized for fuel efficiency and are not as widely valued as traditional gasoline or hybrid options. This places them slightly below gasoline but higher than E85-specific vehicles. 5/10
7. For unrecognized or less common fuel types, a neutral default score of 5 ensures they're neither unfairly penalized nor overly prioritized.
