Returning to my hypothesis, let's analyse key aspects of the plot:

1) Mileage is the most influential factor affecting car price. As mileage increases, the price decreases significantly, showing its critical importance.
2) The year of production is the second most important factor. Newer cars (with a higher year of production) are generally more expensive, highlighting the strong influence of this parameter.
3) Car Tier ranks third in importance, slightly behind the year of production. Its effect on price is reflected through distinct clusters corresponding to different tiers.
4) Engine volume and drivetrain have a reasonable and similar influence on car price. Their impact is noticeable but less significant than mileage, year of production, and car tier.
5) Transmission type, fuel type, and specialness show weak relationships with car price. Among these, Specialness is the least impactful: price remains almost unchanged as specialness increases


Now let's pay attention to correlations to find the truth.


To find out correlations we can use the heatmap graph.
