Now lets add Car Tier_rating column where we will give the brand rating to all of cars
1. The "S-tier" (Super Tier) is the highest rating, commonly used in gaming, car culture, and product reviews to denote exceptional quality. These are the top-of-the-line cars in terms of performance, luxury, technology, and brand prestige. 10/10
2. The "A-tier" includes vehicles that are excellent but might not have the absolute performance or prestige of S-tier cars. They are still high-end in terms of performance, comfort, and features, but maybe not as rare or exclusive as S-tier cars 8/10
3. B-tier cars are still considered good and reliable, but they may lack some of the advanced features, premium materials, or performance found in the higher tiers. These cars are often solid, practical, and well-regarded in their class but do not stand out in the same way as A-tier or S-tier vehicles.
4. C-tier vehicles are generally considered average, with some deficiencies in performance, features, or overall appeal compared to higher-tier vehicles. While these cars can still serve their purpose and may offer value for money, they may lack certain quality or performance features expected in higher-tier vehicles.
5. D-tier cars are considered below average, likely due to poor performance, outdated features, low reliability, or other factors that make them less desirable. They are typically vehicles that fail to meet modern standards or may be in poor condition (e.g., older budget cars or cars that have lost much of their market appeal).
