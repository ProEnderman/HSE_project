In column Car Price lets delete '$' sign, change ',' to '.', transform it to numeric type and multiply by 1000 so we have a number of dollars and nothing else. Also lets delete all NaN rows where the price is not determined
Now lets do the same thing to the "Car Mileage" column. Lets remove the 'mi.' and change ',' to '', transform it to numeric type so we have a number of miles and nothing else. Also lets delete all rows where car mileage is not determined
Lets analogically delete some rows where 1 important detail is undetermined(Drivetrain, Fuel Type, Transmission, Engine) I have checked that there no rows with undetermined Car Name, VIN, TimeStamp or source but we will still check it with code
When we finished with "cleaning" data up it is time to get descriptive statistics. We need descriptive statistics of at least 3 numerical fields but we have only 2 right now.
We can do data transformation and add 3 new columns. First of all, lets extract the year of production of the car and Car Brand from the column "Car Name"
Now lets take a look at our dataset now
